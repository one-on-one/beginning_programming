Being a programmer is sometimes considered as mystical as being a magician. People often look on their programs wondering how they work. Magicians offer the same mysticism with their tricks of illusion. But there's something that magicians don't want anyone else to know: how they do it.

If everyone understood how magic tricks work, it would not be as amazing. In the same fashion, if everyone understood how programming works, it would not be as *mystical*.
