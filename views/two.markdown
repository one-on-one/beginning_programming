This week, we will learn about the most common and vital components of programming: Variables, Data Types 
and Containers. Look at the contact book below. What do you see? After this lesson, look over the image
again and see if you can view it from a programmers perspective.

### Variables

A variable is how a programmer assigns a value to a memory allocation that can be used in a program. Or in other words,
a variable is how you reference data. 

You have probably already used variables when taking Algebra.

It's simple. Here are some example of variables and variable assigment:

<pre><code data-language="ruby">x = 1     # Assigns the variable x with the value of 1
y = 2     # Assigns the variable y with the value of 2
x + y     # Variables x + y is the same as 1 + 2. We get 3
</code></pre>

Variables can contain any type of data, not just numbers. Let's learn about the different data types.

### Data Types

#### String

    puts "hi"

<pre><code data-language="ruby"># Some source code
class Foo
  def bar
    puts "HI"
  end
end
</code></pre>

#### Numeric

#### Boolean

### Containers

#### Array

#### Hash

### Exercise

Review the contact book and determine where the different data types and containers are.
