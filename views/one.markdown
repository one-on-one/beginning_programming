### Open Discussion

* What is programming?
* Why should I learn to program?
* What kind of stuff can I create?
* Can I figure this stuff out?
* How does it work?

### Programming Languages

![](/img/programming-word-cloud.png)

* **PHP** - Designed to be embedded inside HTML to build dynamic Web pages or update them from databases.
* **Java** - Cross-platform applications. For web services and mobile phone apps under Android.

* **Javascript** - For interactivity in web pages and applications. This has no relation to Java.

* **Ruby** - Designed with simplicity in mind. It is interpreted, and has a proprietary but extensible library.

* **C#** - Concurrent to java, runs on .NET or compatible platforms. Windows development is done with C/C++/C#.



### Glossary of Common Terms

**Compiler** - A compiler is a program that reads the program you have written (the "code") and translates it according to the language specs into an executable program.

**Database** - A database is a file that holds information in a structured way, in some respects similiar to a spreadsheet. They are often used in programming to store data and to retrieve that data back for use by the program.

**Algorithm** - An algorithm is a set of instructions or steps used to solve a problem. If someone asked you how to do something, and you told them to "do this, then this, then this, and if you see this do this" you have just given them an algorithm. Programs use algorithms to get results based on data.

**Object Oriented** - Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a recent trend in programming languages. OOP is a redesign of how programmers think about solving problems - instead of using a function and algortihm approach, you think of the "objects" in the program and what they need to do. Don't worry too much about OOP concepts as a beginner. When it is time for you to learn them it will be obvious, and in some cases you may never have to.

**Platform** - Platform refers to the type of hardware and Opeating System you are creating software for. For example, Intel and Windows, or Mac and Mac OS.


### Exercise: Robot Man!

Let's all write a simple program on the whiteboard to get a robot man to pick up an object.

### Homework

1. Perform the simple online course found at [http://tryruby.org/](http://tryruby.org/). A lot of this will be covered in the class over the following weeks but this will get you better prepared.
